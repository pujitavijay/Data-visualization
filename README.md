This project focuses on analyzing Rutgers University's operational budget data to identify key financial trends and support strategic decision-making. The dataset includes categorized revenues, expenses, transfers, and non-operating assets across multiple organizational levelsâ€”campus, unit, division, and GI. Through data preparation, trend analysis, and the development of interactive dashboards, the project enables stakeholders to explore budget allocations, detect anomalies, and compare year-over-year changes in financial activity across the university.
